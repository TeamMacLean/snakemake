# A Checkout Challenge

If you're looking for a task to do in `snakemake` why not try this experiment on the TSL cluster.


On TSL's sequence database we have [this](https://sequences.tsl.ac.uk/project?id=6177bbae3545d74de71ebb85) _Arabidopsis_ project. It contains six samples and two run files per sample. Write a `snakemake` pipeline to

  1. QC the reads with e.g `fastqc`
  2. Find SNPs with e.g `vcftools`
  3. Estimate read counts/TPM with e.g `kallisto`

Happy `snakemake`-ing.
